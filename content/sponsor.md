Aurelia is and always will be MIT licensed and free to use. Our commitment to open source is unwavering. However, maintaining and evolving a framework that competes with corporate-backed alternatives requires significant resources and dedicated effort from our team.

Your support helps us:
- Maintain and improve the core framework
- Develop new features and capabilities
- Create better documentation and learning resources
- Provide community support
- Compete with larger, corporate-backed frameworks

## Ways to Support

You can support Aurelia's development through two platforms:

### GitHub Sponsors
Support us directly through GitHub Sponsors: [github.com/sponsors/aurelia](https://github.com/sponsors/aurelia)

### Open Collective
Join our Open Collective community: [opencollective.com/aurelia](https://opencollective.com/aurelia)

Both platforms allow for one-time donations or recurring sponsorships. While we deeply appreciate all contributions, recurring sponsorships help us plan and sustain long-term development efforts.
