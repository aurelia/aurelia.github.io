As many of you know, we have been hard at work on the next version of Aurelia known as Aurelia 2 for quite some time now. Despite some obstacles (including an ongoing global pandemic), we are happy to announce we are releasing an alpha version of Aurelia 2 on March 2nd, 2021.

We want to thank the community their continued support and patience throughout the Aurelia 2 development process. We really cannot wait for you to try it out.

While we have done quite a lot to ensure that Aurelia 2 is stable and a few people on the core team have been building apps with it, we do not recommend that you use Aurelia 2 in production just yet.

Please keep in mind that the team are currently working on some features which will be released post-alpha including; AOT, Aurelia Store, full server-side offering with a rest server and a few other things in the pipeline.

## What can I expect in Aurelia 2 alpha?

TL;DR quite a lot. Aurelia 2 is a ground-up rewrite that maintains its original identity forged in v1 but is improved in every way imaginable.

- Everything that is in the v1 core
- First-class support for TypeScript
- Ongoing improved documentation
- An advanced scheduler
- Several new compiler and extensibility points
- Out-of-the-box support for; Web Components, Shadow DOM and Constructible Stylesheets
- Async lifecycle hooks
- Imperative component declaration API's
- A native script tag distribution using native modules
- A new feature-rich`@watch` decorator to observe values and other pieces of data
- Automatically computed observation without the needed for any configuration or decorator (no more `@computedFrom`)
- Numerous low-level API's to write more performant web applications as well as provide plugin authors with new ways to build plugins
- Improvements to Aurelia's Dependency Injection
- A test assertion library and Aurelia specific test helpers
- An easy to use e2e test setup based on Playwright 
- Revamped i18n, validation and validation-i18n plugins
- A brand new router, including Direct Routing (convention-based zero-config routing)
- Lifecycle hook sharing API
- Improved composition using `au-compose.`

There is most likely a heap of other things we forgot about in this list, which is why we encourage you to have a play around with Aurelia when the alpha releases on March 2nd, 2021.

You can expect in the lead-up and the coming months ahead, more blog posts, tutorials and Aurelia content on how you can build Aurelia 2 applications and leverage some of the new API's and features.

## Feedback

Throughout the alpha process, we encourage everyone to feedback (good and bad). If there is a new feature in Aurelia 2 you like, we would love to hear it. And if there is an issue you've encountered or something doesn't seem right, we welcome your feedback.
