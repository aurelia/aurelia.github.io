If you have been on the internet long enough, you probably remember Digg. The social news aggregator was a major player in the mid-2000s before its infamous redesign sent users fleeing to Reddit. Well, Digg is back, and this time it has communities.

And yes, [Aurelia has one](https://digg.com/aurelia).

## What is the Aurelia Community on Digg?

The Aurelia community on Digg is a dedicated space for discussing all things Aurelia. Whether you want to share projects you have built, ask questions about the framework, or just connect with other Aurelia developers, this is another place to do it.

Think of it as one more spot in the Aurelia ecosystem where you can hang out and talk shop.

## Why Digg?

Digg's relaunch has brought back the community-focused features that made it popular in the first place, but with a modern approach. Communities on Digg allow for focused discussions around specific topics, and having an Aurelia presence there means we can reach developers who might not be on Discord or other platforms.

The more places Aurelia has a presence, the easier it is for developers to find us and join the community.

## Join Us

Head over to [digg.com/aurelia](https://digg.com/aurelia) and join the community. Share your Aurelia projects, ask questions, and help grow the Aurelia presence on the platform.

Of course, our primary community hub remains [Discord](https://discord.gg/TPV3cvCZhz), where you will find the most active discussions and direct access to the core team. But having multiple communities means more opportunities for developers to discover Aurelia and connect with others using the framework.

See you on Digg.
