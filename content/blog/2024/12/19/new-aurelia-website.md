Let’s cut to the chase: **yeah, we know we haven’t published a blog post in a while**. Trust us, it hasn’t been for lack of trying. 

The old website had its charm, but let’s be honest—it wasn’t exactly user-friendly behind the scenes. Built on a bespoke system, even something as seemingly simple as publishing a blog post felt like jumping through hoops. If you’ve ever had to debug a release process just to share a bit of news, you’ll know the pain.

But that’s all in the past. The new Aurelia website is here, and with it, we’re putting all that clunkiness to bed. It’s fast, modern, and most importantly, designed to make things easier for us—and for you. Let's call it an early Christmas present.

## A Fresh Start: A Cleaner, Modern Aurelia Website

The first thing you’ll notice is the design overhaul. We didn’t just slap on a fresh coat of paint; we tore the whole thing down and rebuilt it with a focus on **clarity** and **usability**. Here’s what’s new:

- **Modern design:** Sleek, clean, and up-to-date with today’s web standards. No fluff, no distractions—just what you need.
- **Simplified navigation:** We’ve restructured everything so you can find what you’re looking for without a scavenger hunt.
- **Mobile-first:** Because we know you’re not always at your desk, the site now looks and works beautifully on any device.
- **New playground:** We've added a new playground to the website to help you learn and experiment with Aurelia. Examples showcasing the framework's capabilities are now available to help you get started. Over time this will expand with more examples and features.

## Content is Back: Regular Blog Updates

Let’s address the elephant in the room: the blog has been quiet. Too quiet. That changes now. With the new site, we’re committing to **frequent, meaningful updates**. Expect content like:

- **Guides and tutorials:** Whether you’re a newcomer or a seasoned Aurelia developer, we’ll have content tailored for you. We've got some resources coming around migration to Aurelia 2 for the O.G Aurelia 1 developers.
- **Deep dives:** We’ll take you under the hood of Aurelia, sharing insights into its design and upcoming features.
- **Case studies and community spotlights:** Showcasing the amazing things developers are building with Aurelia.

No more delays, no more excuses. The new site is built to get content out faster, and we plan to use it. If you're a member of the Aurelia community, you can help us by submitting blog posts, tutorials, and other content too.

## A More Connected Aurelia Community

One of the big goals with the new site is to strengthen the connection between the framework and its community. Here’s how we’re doing it:

- **Dedicated support and learning hubs:** Centralized resources to help you succeed with Aurelia.
- **Community highlights:** A space to feature your projects, libraries, and contributions. We will have a dedicated section for this in future, but in the interim, we'll use the blog to highlight community contributions.
- **Interactive features:** From polls to live discussions, we’re building ways for you to engage directly with the Aurelia team and other developers.

We want this to be more than just a website—it’s a home base for anyone building with Aurelia.

## What’s Next? Aurelia 2 Roadmap for 2025

We know many of you are eager to see a stable release of Aurelia 2 (it's not dead, trust us). We’re saving the details for another blog post, but here’s a quick teaser of what’s coming in the **Aurelia 2 roadmap for 2025**:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and hydration improvements.**
- **Partial AOT (ahead of time) compilation** to speed up build times.
- **Performance optimizations** and **developer tooling upgrades**.
- **Support for more tooling and libraries** to help you build your apps.
- **Expanded documentation** and learning resources.
  
This roadmap isn’t just a list of features; it’s our vision for making Aurelia the best choice for developers in 2025 and beyond.

## A Thank You to the Community

None of this would be possible without your support. To everyone who stuck with Aurelia through the quiet times, shared feedback, or contributed in any way: **thank you**. This new website, the content we’re creating, and the plans we’re making for Aurelia’s future are all for you.

Rumors of Aurelia's demise have been greatly exaggerated.

## Explore the New Aurelia

The new Aurelia website is live, and we’re excited for you to see it. Visit the site, dive into the blog, and let us know what you think. This is just the beginning, 2025 and beyond is going to be a big year for Aurelia.

Stay tuned for the detailed **Aurelia 2 roadmap**, coming soon.
