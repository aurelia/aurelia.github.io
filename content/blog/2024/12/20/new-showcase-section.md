While we have only just recently launched the new website, we've been working on a few new features and improvements.

We've added a new showcase section to the website to showcase the latest and greatest Aurelia plugins, components and tools. The idea is to have a place where we can showcase your Aurelia plugins, components, tools and apps.

While we've only just launched this section, we're already working on adding more features to it. We're also working on a new way to showcase your Aurelia plugins, components and tools.

If you're interested in showcasing your Aurelia plugins, components and tools, submit a pull request to the [Website repository](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia.github.io) and add it to the `content/showcase` directory. You can copy other showcase items as a reference for how to structure your content.
