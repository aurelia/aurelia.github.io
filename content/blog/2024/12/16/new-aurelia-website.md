Let’s cut to the chase: **yeah, we know we haven’t published a blog post in a while**. Trust us, it hasn’t been for lack of trying. The old website had its charm, but let’s be honest—it wasn’t exactly user-friendly behind the scenes. Built on a bespoke system, even something as seemingly simple as publishing a blog post felt like jumping through hoops. If you’ve ever had to debug a release process just to share a bit of news, you’ll know the pain.

But that’s all in the past. The new Aurelia website is here, and with it, we’re putting all that clunkiness to bed. It’s fast, modern, and most importantly, designed to make things easier for us—and for you.

## A Fresh Start: A Cleaner, Modern Aurelia Website

The first thing you’ll notice is the design overhaul. We didn’t just slap on a fresh coat of paint; we tore the whole thing down and rebuilt it with a focus on **clarity** and **usability**. Here’s what’s new:

- **Modern design:** Sleek, clean, and up-to-date with today’s web standards. No fluff, no distractions—just what you need.
- **Simplified navigation:** We’ve restructured everything so you can find what you’re looking for without a scavenger hunt.
- **Mobile-first:** Because we know you’re not always at your desk, the site now looks and works beautifully on any device.

And on the backend? There is no backend. The new site is built on a static site generator, which means we can publish content faster and more easily. We've also integrated Aurelia 2 into the site, which means we can showcase the latest and greatest features of the framework right here without having to worry about embeds.

## Content is Back: Regular Blog Updates

Let’s address the elephant in the room: the blog has been quiet. Too quiet. That changes now. With the new site, we’re committing to **frequent, meaningful updates**. Expect content like:

- **Guides and tutorials:** Whether you’re a newcomer or a seasoned Aurelia developer, we’ll have content tailored for you.
- **Deep dives:** We’ll take you under the hood of Aurelia, sharing insights into its design and upcoming features.
- **Case studies and community spotlights:** Showcasing the amazing things developers are building with Aurelia.

No more delays, no more excuses. The new site is built to get content out faster, and we plan to use it.

## A More Connected Aurelia Community

One of the big goals with the new site is to strengthen the connection between the framework and its community. Here’s how we’re doing it:

- **Dedicated support and learning hubs:** Centralized resources to help you succeed with Aurelia.
- **Community highlights:** A space to feature your projects, libraries, and contributions.
- **Interactive features:** From polls to live discussions, we’re building ways for you to engage directly with the Aurelia team and other developers.

We want this to be more than just a website—it’s a home base for anyone building with Aurelia.

## What’s Next? Aurelia 2 Roadmap for 2025

We’re saving the details for another blog post (because trust us, there’s a lot), but here’s a quick teaser of what’s coming in the **Aurelia 2 roadmap for 2025**:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and hydration improvements.**
- **Decorators and other emerging JavaScript standards.**
- **Performance optimizations** and **developer tooling upgrades**.
- **Expanded documentation** and learning resources.
  
This roadmap isn’t just a list of features; it’s our vision for making Aurelia the best choice for developers in 2025 and beyond.

## A Thank You to the Community

None of this would be possible without your support. To everyone who stuck with Aurelia through the quiet times, shared feedback, or contributed in any way: **thank you**. This new website, the content we’re creating, and the plans we’re making for Aurelia’s future are all for you.

Rumors of Aurelia's demise have been greatly exaggerated.
