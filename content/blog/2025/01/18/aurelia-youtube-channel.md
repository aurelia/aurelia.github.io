Your new go-to spot for all things Aurelia, with videos to help you master everything from the fundamentals to advanced techniques.

We've been listening to the community, and a common request has been more video content on Aureliaâ€”especially for advanced topics. So, we're thrilled to announce the launch of our [official Aurelia YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@aureliaeffect) ðŸŽ‰.

Years ago, Rob Eisenberg's Vimeo videos were a fantastic resource for learning Aurelia, and we want to bring that same spirit backâ€”updated and better than ever. We were going to announce the channel once we had some content ready, but we wanted to let you know that we've got something coming in the next few days and then regular content will be posted after.

Sure, the Aurelia docs are packed with great information, but we know not everyone wants to sift through text. Sometimes, watching someone walk through a concept or demo can make all the difference, and that's where this channel comes in.

What to Expect:
* Regularly posted videos to build your Aurelia skills, from beginner to pro.
* Fundamentals for those starting out and advanced content for seasoned devs (lower-level APIs and other advanced topics)
* Content planned for the next few weeks, with fresh uploads dropping soon. (Spoiler: the first one's just a few days away!)

We're excited about this new chapter and hope you'll join us on the journey. Subscribe to the channel to stay in the loop and never miss a new upload.
