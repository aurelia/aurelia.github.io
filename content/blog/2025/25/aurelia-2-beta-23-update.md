We have just released beta 23, which includes a number of improvements and fixes which you can read more about on our releases page on [GitHub](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/releases).

In addition to beta 23 (in case you haven't already noticed), we've launched a brand-new website! This is a complete rebuild from the ground up. The old Aurelia site served us well for years, but it was starting to show its age and had its fair share of issues around updates and deployments. The fresh design and improved functionality reflect where Aurelia is heading—better, faster, and easier to use—both as a framework and as a community. Plus, as you've probably seen, we're publishing on the blog much more frequently now.

You could say we've been busy since beta 22 was released.

## New Video Tutorials

Speaking of content, we've also launched a new initiative to create video tutorials for the community. Many of you have told us how helpful Rob's old Vimeo videos were back in the day for learning Aurelia. Those deep dives into low-level concepts laid the groundwork for a lot of your skills, and we thought it was about time to bring that back.

So far, we've released two videos:

- [AppTasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR5pdsYh1uU)
- [Working with Synthetic Views, including view factories and view slots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlU1tf1oKPY)

If you haven't checked them out yet, they're live now, and we'd love your feedback on what other topics you'd like to see covered. If you haven't already subscribed, our channel is [here](https://www.youtube.com/@aureliaeffect).

## Documentation Improvements

Improving documentation is another area we're doubling down on. The Aurelia 2 docs are seeing ongoing updates to make them easier to follow, especially in areas like working with synthetic views. On top of that, the Aurelia 1 docs have also been given a significant overhaul. They're now better organized and easier to navigate, ensuring that those of you maintaining Aurelia 1 apps in production still have a top-tier resource to rely on.

We're not abandoning Aurelia 1 developers—far from it. We know a lot of you have invested heavily in Aurelia 1, and we're committed to supporting you for the foreseeable future.

## Beta 23: What's New?

Now, let's dive into the latest beta release: beta 23. Initially, this was intended to be the platform for our move to an async observation system. However, after evaluating the complexity and importance of this feature, we've decided to push it back to beta 24, with further stabilization and refinements expected in beta 25, leading to a more finalized implementation in beta 26.

The observation system is the backbone of Aurelia, and it's critical to get it right. These updates are the main reason we've held off on releasing a release candidate. We'd rather take the time now to make sure the observation system is rock solid than rush out an RC and later discover edge cases we missed. Stability and reliability are non-negotiable when it comes to core features like this.

## Where is the Roadmap?

We know many of you are curious about the roadmap for Aurelia. Currently, we are in the process of going through existing issues, pull requests, and priorities to compile a cleaner and more actionable roadmap. This roadmap will live in GitHub and provide a realistic depiction of where things are at and when you can expect updates.

There are a few administrative tasks we need to complete to ensure the roadmap is accurate and achievable. Once finalized, it will serve as a central source of truth for the community, giving everyone a clearer picture of Aurelia's development trajectory.

## Moving Forward

We're incredibly excited about the progress we're making with Aurelia 2, and we can't wait for you to get your hands on the upcoming releases. Your feedback has been invaluable in shaping the framework, and we're grateful to have such a passionate and engaged community.

Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, let us know how we can help you make the most of Aurelia. If you need to get in touch, you can find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/SMaXVZMReK), the [Aurelia Forums](https://discourse.aurelia.io/), or [GitHub](https://github.com/aureliaeffect).
