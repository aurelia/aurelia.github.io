## üö® Breaking Changes

Aurelia 2 Beta 24 introduces important breaking changes, but as always, we've got you covered with the details below.

### **Vite Plugin: Vite v6 Support**
- The Vite plugin now requires Vite v6. Update your project dependencies accordingly.  
[Commit](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/commit/5834d05)

### **Templating: Controller Host Removal**
- We've changed how Aurelia handles custom element hosts: if a host is already tied to another custom element, Aurelia won't create a new one. This mostly helps you avoid surprises/magic behaviors.
[Commit](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/commit/402c746)

### **DOM: Toggle $au and $aurelia**
- You can now hide the `$au` and `$aurelia` properties on DOM elements. If you want to make it harder for others to poke around or reverse engineer your app's internals, this is for you.  
[Commit](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/commit/7e1057b)

### **Type-Checking: Non-Public Members**
- Type-checking now supports non-public members, improving tooling and developer experience.  
[Commit](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/commit/165c213)

### **Documentation: New Tutorials & Guides**
- Tutorials for integrating Svelte, building with AI, creating a weather app, using web workers, websockets, and advanced list rendering and lambda expressions are now available.  
[Commit](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/commit/583d98d)

## ‚ú® New Features

### **Multiple `.class` Values in Templates**
- The template compiler now supports multiple `.class` values, making it easier to manage dynamic classes. The docs have also been updated to reflect this new behavior.
[Commit](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/commit/3b7513a)

### **Router-Lite: Navigation Strategy**
- New navigation strategy support in `router-lite` enables more flexible routing scenarios.  
[Commit](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/commit/6a7757f)

### **DOM: Toggle $au and $aurelia**
- You can now toggle the `$au` and `$aurelia` properties on DOM elements. This feature is designed to allow applications to make it harder to poke into or reverse engineer the view model/component trees of an Aurelia application. Some apps may wish to hide these properties completely for security or privacy reasons.  
[Commit](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/commit/7e1057b)

### **Type-Checking: Non-Public Members**
- Type-checking now supports non-public members, improving tooling and developer experience.

### **Documentation: New Tutorials & Guides**
- Tutorials for integrating Svelte, building with AI, creating a weather app, using web workers, websockets, and advanced list rendering and lambda expressions are now available.
