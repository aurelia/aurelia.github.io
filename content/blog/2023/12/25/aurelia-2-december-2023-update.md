## Documentation Overhaul:

We've made extensive updates to our documentation with the following improvements:

- Deep linkable sections, making it easier to navigate directly to key topics such as templating syntax.
- The aim of our refactoring effort was to reduce noise and break down massive walls of text into more digestible content.
- Expanded sections with more explanations, code examples, and details, particularly in areas like the fetch client and binding behaviors.
- Comprehensive documentation of return types, requests, and advanced scenarios for the fetch client.
- A sweep of grammatical fixes to polish our docs.
- Coverage of some previously undocumented or lesser-known features and APIs in Aurelia.
- New recipes added for integrating technologies like Cordova/Phonegap, Apollo GraphQL, and SignalR.
